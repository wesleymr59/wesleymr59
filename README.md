- ðŸ“„ Know about my experiences [I am a back-end developer and tech lead, with solid experience in developing REST APIs using Python and Go. I work full-time, where I lead backend and mobile teams, focusing on creating microservices and ensuring efficient collaboration between teams. My stack includes FastAPI, Socket, SQLAlchemy, MongoDB, Redis and Docker, as well as several AWS tools such as SQS, S3, ECS, API Gateway and Cognito. I work following practices such as Clean Code, SOLID principles and Clean Architecture, with a focus on observability using Graylog and Grafana Loki. I have a degree in Systems Analysis and Development from Fatec GarÃ§a and two postgraduate degrees in Software Engineering and IT Management from Faculdade Focus. My mission is to continuously improve my skills in software architecture and modeling, especially with a focus on Python, Go, C# and Clean Arch, Hexagonal and MVC, applied to the creation of MVP projects. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow and contribute to the team's success.](I am a back-end developer and tech lead, with solid experience in developing REST APIs using Python and Go.
